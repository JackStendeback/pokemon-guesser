// User can still interact with 'Gen' buttons during loading gif.
// Sometimes when loaded, a pokemon will appear for selection and then switch to another.
// Toggle button doesn't switch text until it is clicked once. (Stays on 'Toggle Light Mode' until clicked twice).
// Potential backend integration to get data from users?
// Girritina says it is from generation 1.
// Magmortar is not from generation 7
// Get rid of 'Incorrect red bar' after next pokemon appears
